  // This example models a command set for 2 dimensional movement. Each command
  // is represented in TLV form.

  // The type field is a 1 byte uint8 with the following mappings:
  //  - 0 = GO command, followed by a length of 0 and no value
  //  - 1 = STOP command, followed by a length of 0 and no value
  //  - 2 = TURN LEFT command, followed by a length of 1-2 and whose value is a uint8 or uint16,
  //        representing an integer number of degrees to turn
  //  - 3 = TURN RIGHT command, followed by a length of 1-2 and whose value is a uint8 or uint16,
  //        representing an integer number of degrees to turn
  //
  // The length field is a 1 byte uint8.
  //
  // Unrecognized commands must be decoded.
